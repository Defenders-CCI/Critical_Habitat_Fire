This repository contains code to analyze the overlap between areas burned by wildfire in the American West and designated critical habitat of species listed on the U.S. Endangered Species List

## Code
The state_data.py, fire_data.py, ch_data.py, and analysis.py files provide tools and methods for scraping data from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service ECOS database, as well as from the Interagency Fire Center, performing geospatial analyses of overlap and area calculations.
Functions.py and fireapp.py contain code used to build and deploy an interactive Dash app.
